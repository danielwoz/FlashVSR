This is a fork that less particular about versions, works with more modern software, and is updated for blackwell.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielwoz/FlashVSR.git
python setup.py bdist_wheels
python setup.py install
```

You will also want my updated version of block_sparse_attn:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/danielwoz/Block-Sparse-Attention.git
MAX_JOBS=4 python setup.py bdist_wheels
MAX_JOBS=4 python setup.py install
```

Block sparse attention is mostly the flash attention code base with some modifications, if your having trouble building it, search for flash-attn and your error message.

### 🌟 Abstract

Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving **efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance**. To this end, we propose **FlashVSR**, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. **FlashVSR runs at ∼17 FPS for 768 × 1408 videos on a single A100 GPU** by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train–test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct **VSR-120K**, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves **state-of-the-art performance with up to ∼12× speedup** over prior one-step diffusion VSR models.

### 📰 News

- **Release Date:** October 2025 — Inference code and model weights are available now! 🎉  
- **Bug Fix (October 21, 2025):** Fixed `local_attention_mask` update logic to prevent artifacts when switching between different aspect ratios during continuous inference.  
- **Coming Soon:** Dataset release (**VSR-120K**) for large-scale training.

### 📢 Important Quality Note (ComfyUI & other third-party implementations)

First of all, huge thanks to the community for the fast adoption, feedback, and contributions to FlashVSR! 🙌  
During community testing, we noticed that some third-party implementations of FlashVSR (e.g. early ComfyUI versions) do **not include our Locality-Constrained Sparse Attention (LCSA)** module and instead fall back to **dense attention**. This may lead to **noticeable quality degradation**, especially at higher resolutions.  
Community discussion: https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/issues/1441

Below is a comparison example provided by a community member:

| Fig.1 – LR Input Video | Fig.2 – 3rd-party (no LCSA) | Fig.3 – Official FlashVSR |

✅ The **official FlashVSR pipeline (this repository)**:
- **Better preserves fine structures and details**
- **Effectively avoids texture aliasing and visual artifacts**

We are also working on a **version that does not rely on the Block-Sparse Attention library** while keeping **the same output quality**; this alternative may run slower than the optimized original implementation.

Thanks again to the community for actively testing and helping improve FlashVSR together! 🚀

### 📋 TODO

- ✅ Release inference code and model weights  
- ⬜ Release dataset (VSR-120K)

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run **FlashVSR** on your local machine:

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is primarily designed and optimized for **4× video super-resolution**.  
> We **strongly recommend** using the **4× SR setting** to achieve better results and stability. ✅

#### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenImagingLab/FlashVSR
cd FlashVSR
````

#### 2️⃣ Set Up the Python Environment

Create and activate the environment (**Python 3.11.13**):

```bash
conda create -n flashvsr python=3.11.13
conda activate flashvsr
```

Install project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3️⃣ Install Block-Sparse Attention (Required)

FlashVSR relies on the **Block-Sparse Attention** backend to enable flexible and dynamic attention masking for efficient inference.

> **⚠️ Note:**
>
> * The Block-Sparse Attention build process can be memory-intensive, especially when compiling in parallel with multiple `ninja` jobs. It is recommended to keep sufficient memory available during compilation to avoid OOM errors. Once the build is complete, runtime memory usage is stable and not an issue.
> * Based on our testing, the Block-Sparse Attention backend works correctly on **NVIDIA A100 and A800** (Ampere) with **ideal acceleration performance**, and it also runs correctly on **H200** (Hopper) but the acceleration is limited due to hardware scheduling differences and sparse kernel behavior. **Compatibility and performance on other GPUs (e.g., RTX 40/50 series or H800) are currently unknown**. For more details, please refer to the official documentation: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/Block-Sparse-Attention


```bash
# ✅ Recommended: clone and install in a separate clean folder (outside the FlashVSR repo)
git clone https://github.com/mit-han-lab/Block-Sparse-Attention
cd Block-Sparse-Attention
pip install packaging
pip install ninja
python setup.py install
```

#### 4️⃣ Download Model Weights from Hugging Face

Weights are hosted on **Hugging Face** via **Git LFS**. Please install Git LFS first:

```bash
# From the repo root
cd examples/WanVSR

# Install Git LFS (once per machine)
git lfs install

# Clone the model repository into examples/WanVSR
git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/JunhaoZhuang/FlashVSR
```

After cloning, you should have:

```
./examples/WanVSR/FlashVSR/
│
├── LQ_proj_in.ckpt                                   
├── TCDecoder.ckpt                                    
├── Wan2.1_VAE.pth                                    
├── diffusion_pytorch_model_streaming_dmd.safetensors 
└── README.md
```

> The inference scripts will load weights from `./examples/WanVSR/FlashVSR/` by default.

#### 5️⃣ Run Inference

```bash
# From the repo root
cd examples/WanVSR
python infer_flashvsr_full.py      # Full model
# or
python infer_flashvsr_tiny.py      # Tiny model
```
